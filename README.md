This study investigates the impact of primary network and co-channel interference on the secrecy outage probability and strictly positive secrecy capacity of an underlay cognitive decode-and-forward relay network in Rayleigh fading channels. We consider a single eavesdropper node that tries to steal the transmitted signal at each hop. The secrecy outage probability and the strictly positive secrecy capacity are theoretically derived as a function of the interference sources and fading channels, which has not been studied in the literature. The theoretical results are validated with Monte Carlo simulation results. Consequently, the results show that the secrecy outage probability and the strictly positive secrecy capacity drastically degrade when the number of co-channel interference sources and the PN interference power increase.
